Ultimate Arena's source is free to view but we ask that you have a copy of the game if you want to use it. Please only distribute to those who own a copy of the game. For more info read our license for the full terms.

If you're interested in making major adjustments/mods/changes drop us a line. We love to support our community as best as we can.

A short note from the Director:

Typically whenever a developer has a game open sourced like this one might think that we're trying to get out of some work by recuiting help from the community and while we're going to plead the 5th on that particular point I think there's also the fact that we wanted the world to know that behind the scenes of this game there's quite a bit of nonsense and mistakes as well as a touch of genius that might make you think about programming diffferently. 

We hope that you will contribute to this crazy mess that we've grown to love over the past 10 months or so and find your way into the credits of the world's most advanced battle royale simulator: Ultimate Arena
